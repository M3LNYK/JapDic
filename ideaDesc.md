## Idea description
Idea is to retrieve data from my [quizlet form link](https://quizlet.com/pl/957743446/japanese-a1-flash-cards/). I have, and will add words there which I want to convert easily into table using python.

Simple algo desc:
1. Create list of terms
2. Retrive new terms
3. Check if terms in the list
4. Add to list new terms
5. Extract as table new terms
6. Finish

## Possible problems now:
- [ ] Find element that stores terms on page
    - [ ] Eng
    - [ ] Jap
- [ ] Retrive element w terms
- [ ] Store in code
    - [ ] Create local version of table and compare?
- [ ] Store in table
- [ ] Extract table file
